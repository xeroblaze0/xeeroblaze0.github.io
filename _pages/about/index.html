<p>My name is Alex Hay, I work at the intersection of engineering and neuroscience in the field of rehabilitation, specifically control of prostethic devices.</p> <p>Disability or impairment in the wake of trauma may be difficult or impossible for the body to overcome. My professional goal is to help build systems that interact with the body to improve function, strength, and ability. By understanding how the bodyâ€™s underlying systems operates and communicate, we can build devices that interact with the body in a much more natural way.</p>
